    <p>The algorithms course on khan academy was very interesting to me. It talked about most of the types of searches, recursive algorithms, Graphs something that I did originally think that too much to
    do with algorithms, THe towers of hanoi was a small fun thing to do as well. But the thing im taking with me the most would be the asymptotic notation, at first I was very confused and didn't understand it
    very well at all but once I re-read it a few times I now understand it much better. It is used to find the run time of a function with respect to the size of variables in the function. Big-O is the longest possible time for the algorithm to finish and big omega is the best that can happen for the data size
    big theta is the mix of both its finding the point between the worst and best possible case. Here are some of the projects I did.</p>

    <p>There was one more thing that we did this year that was related to algorithms and that was the pyraminx I found it to be lots of fun after applying my self to it for one class i was able to find situations that you need to apply an algotithm to aolve the problem
    of the unslove "cube". I had lots of fun with it and is something that I wont forget from this class. <a href="https://github.com/IanMcAllister/Cubing/blob/master/README.md">For more information go to this repo  </p>
