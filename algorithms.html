    <p>The algorithms course on khan academy was very interesting to me. It talked about most of the types of serches, recursive algorithms, Graphs soemthing that I did origionly think that to much to
    do with algorithms, THe towers of hanoi was a small fun thing to do as well. But the thing im taking with me the most would be the asymtopic notation, at first I was very confused and didnt uderstand it
    very well at all but once I re-read it a few times I now understand it much better. It is used to find the run time of a function with respect to the size of variables in the function. Big-o is the longest possible time for the algorithm to finish and big omega is the best that can happen for the data size
    big theta is the mix of both its finding the point between the worst and best possible case. Here are some of the projects I did.</p>
