    <p>Natural simulations was fun for the first few thing we did with the randomness, perlin noise and even inroduction to vectors. after that things got alot more difficult but this doe snot mean that I did not learn anything
     this probably made me learn even more. Things like vectors are very important to object oriented programs that you interact with, making things move around in a simulation of the real world was more fun and interesting then origianly expected.
     things like forces, rotations, osscilations and particle systems are other things that I learned and how to apply in other ways. here are some of the projects I did</p>
