      Intro to javascript seemed very long and boring while doing it it was just the basics, and stuff I know from coding in javascript before hand. This does not mean tha ti did not learn anything
      I felt that a could do much more than before. The things that I gained from intro to JS was mainly the object oriented things near the end but they also talked about variables, mouse movement, user interaction
      and arrays. Here are the projects that I did in into to JS.
