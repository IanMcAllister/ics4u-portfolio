      <p>Into to HTML was one of the first things we did this year and got me into the
      swing of HTML. I learned lots of things such as the basics of html, and css after I was able to understand them I moved onto
      bigger and brighter concepts like embeding. They seem like such easy things but they are very important to learn. Here is more indepth about what I learned.
      <ul>
        <li>The basics</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic HTML tags</li>
            <li>text tags</li>
            <li>Lists</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Css basics</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Background colour</li>
                <li>Text font, size and colour</li>
                <li>How to call ID's and classes</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Putting links</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Internal links</li>
                <li>External links</li>
              </ul>
      </ul>
      There is still lots in HTML that i heave yet to learn but this clas was just the basics but I feel like it was one of the most important to start off with.
      here are some of the projects I did in the class on Khan academy.
