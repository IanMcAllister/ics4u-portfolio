    <p>Making webpages interactive with jQuery on khan academy got me back into the swing of things with html after a few months of not using it at all. this the section I learned how to make webpages
      I make more interactive by using JS in my html sites using the script tag (the same one i use to embed the projects). Things like making forms, events and slideshows are things I leearned in this section
      I found this one to be a good breath of frash air from JS. Here are some projects I made.
