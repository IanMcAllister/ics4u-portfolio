<p>The microbit was a fun thing to do to bring our coding to the real world. Even with a very limited peice of hardware it was fun to watch what we made come to the real world.
 I did not learn to much from this. One thing that I did learn was because we are working as a team we have to make sure that we understand what both of us are doing and how to incorporate both of our code.
this was possible with github. The code below is what we made, It doesnt work properly on the microbit website but it works on if you use a real micro bit.</p>

<code>
    input.onGesture(Gesture.TiltLeft, function () {<br>
    while (input.isGesture(Gesture.TiltLeft)) {<br>
        sprite.change(LedSpriteProperty.X, -1)<br>
        sprite.ifOnEdgeBounce()<br>
        basic.pause(1000)<br>
    }<br>
})<br>
input.onGesture(Gesture.TiltRight, function () {<br>
    while (input.isGesture(Gesture.TiltRight)) {<br>
        sprite.change(LedSpriteProperty.X, 1)<br>
        sprite.ifOnEdgeBounce()<br>
        basic.pause(1000)<br>
    }<br>
})<br>
input.onGesture(Gesture.ScreenDown, function () {<br>
    while (input.isGesture(Gesture.ScreenDown)) {<br>
        sprite.change(LedSpriteProperty.Y, 1)<br>
        sprite.ifOnEdgeBounce()<br>
        basic.pause(1000)<br>
    }<br>
})<br>
input.onGesture(Gesture.ScreenUp, function () {<br>
    while (input.isGesture(Gesture.ScreenUp)) {<br>
        sprite.change(LedSpriteProperty.Y, -1)<br>
        sprite.ifOnEdgeBounce()<br>
        basic.pause(1000)<br>
    }<br>
})<br>
let sprite: game.LedSprite = null <br>
sprite = game.createSprite(2, 2) <br>
