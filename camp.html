      <p>I only did free code camp for a very limited amount of time I did the JS basics and learned a few things that Khan didnt teach me.
      It started with the very basics like adding, subtracting, but ny the end it talked about string manipulation something that khan academy did not teach
      in the courses I took. I felt this was very helpful  because it is something that can be necessary for some projects. The project I did was the palindrome project here it is.</p>
