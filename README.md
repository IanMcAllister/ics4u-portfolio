	Summarize your experience with khan academy.

My experience with Khan academy was in general very good, there were some ups and downs but I would say that it was a very positive experience. The things that I find khan academy good at teaching subjects little by little, They would start on the basics of one topic then slowly expand until they get to the more complex stuff of that topic. But I found that this did not happen as well in Natural simulations i felt like they should have done things in small chunks instead of teaching two concepts per challenge to keep things more streamlined, luckily this was one of the only times this happened but the topic that I think they should improve on the most in NS is the rotation one. It was a hard concept to grasp for me and some of my peers and they took that topic too fast and the challenges covered lots of topics at the same time something I feel like should be reserved for the projects. This may be what it's like in university but they might want to tone back the difficulty a slight bit. Luckily that was the only bad experience I had with khan academy sure some of the other lessons/ courses could feel like they drag on forever but it teaches you everything you need. Once again all in all my experiences are very positive with khan academy for learning both HTML in intro to HTML, Jquery and DOM and JS for intro to JS, Games and visualizations and then For most of Natural simulations. I also found the Algorithms course to be very interesting. I feel like I exponentially expanded my knowledge on that subject and I feel like my programing can be much better after walking myself through the class.






	Summarize your experience with freecodecamp.

My experience with free code camp was very brief compared to khan academy. Originally I hated it \I found it to be annoying with how they get mad at you for missing one capital letter. But after doing one segment of the JS course I enjoyed it a lot, even more so than khan academy maybe its because they taught the concepts in a very clear and precise way, they did one thing at a time but very quickly and efficiently I feel like if I put the same amount of time in each of them and they are teaching the same curriculum I would learn more in free code camp then Khan academy. It at first seems intimidating to look at all of the things you need to do but if you put headphones in and focus for an hour you can get a huge amount of it done in a very short amount of time. And if you ever are stuck on one of the things you can look at a hint sure it can be abused but if you want to continue in computer science why not put the time and effort to learn more about the thing your practicing. I feel like I neglected free code camp at first because i just wanted to get khan done but looking back on it I found it much more enjoyable then khan academy.


	What does it mean to have good programming practices?

To have good programming practices is to do multiple things to keep your code coherent, organised and all in all better for other people who may want to look at it. Things like commenting, a consistent naming scheme for variables, Not nesting to many things together (loops, if statements) are all things that are good programming practices. I have a few of these things but when not forced to comment then I tend not to and it's one thing I should definitely improve on because I want to continue in this field. Other things you can do to have good programming practices is to think of what and how you are going to make the program before hand i feel like this step was and is skipped a lot especially in this school environment because everything is very short and straightforward this is still a very important step to keep you on track you can do this by taking some time before hand to make a flowchart or pseudocode. Another thing you can do is to code in small chunks and test it piece by piece until it is complete and test each piece you complete to weed out bugs that may occur
