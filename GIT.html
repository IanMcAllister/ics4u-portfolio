    <p>This was my first experience with Git hub and I found it to be very useful it tought me everything I needed to know and how to do it. Things like having diffrent branches, pull requests, how to work on something with many diffrent people
     are all things i learned with the git hub courses. It got me off on the right foot for the star of the semester even with one of the courses not working it still found it enjoy able. Click the link below to go to my GitHub page and look at the courses repo's</p>
